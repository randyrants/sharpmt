<div id="headline">Welcome to SharpMT 3</div>
<i>"It's deja vu, all over again" [Yogi Berra]</i>
<br><br>

This is the third generation of an application that was created out of necessity over anything else. I write a Blog of my own (<a href="http://www.randyrants.com" target="_blank">RandyRants.com</a>) and I try to get two or three new entries posted to it a week. I currently use <a href="http://www.typepad.org/" target="_blank">TypePad</a> but have historically used MovableType (MT) - http://www.movabletype.org/ - to host my Blog, which provides a number of tools for posting new and editing exiting Blog entries. Thankfully MT and TypePad are completely compatible, so this project can continue to be useful.  Anyway, to use these tools, your PC needs to be online - because I find that I write the majority of my new Blog entries offline, I needed something new. 
<br><br>
I tried a few different tools out there that promised exactly that: offline authoring. However, most of these applications were written with the most generic set of blog fields possible, to support the largest number of blogging servers possible. I use TypePad/MT and I needed all of the fields that were specifically offered, so these existing tools didn't work for me. Also, I found that when I wanted to link new entries to existing entries, I had to go online and dig through my old posts to find the article link, which was painful at times. 
<br><br>
And so I started SharpMT which now continues its evolution.

<div id="subheadline">Troubleshooting</div>

<ol>

<li>Q: I tried to run your application, but I'm getting a huge message box, with an error that tells me it can't
find some DLL files.  What's wrong?<br>
Q: I installed SharpMT on my computer and when I start the program up it says it can't find MSCOREE.DLL.<br><br>
A: Your PC doesn't have the 1.1 version of the .NET Framework installed on it yet!  You can get this from the 
Windows Update website for Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP (Professional or Home),
 and Windows Server 2003.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: You said you'd never offer online-editing but 2.0 has it - why the change and how does it work?<br><br>
A: To modify a server based entry, you first must have the Blog Link that represents the entry in your Blog Link list.  Once 
there, double click the Blog Link in question - or right mouse click and select Edit - and a new tab will appear in the SharpMT 
window.  You should notice a couple of things at this point, first being that the icon next to the name of the draft will be a 
Blog Link icon and the name of the draft doesn't end in .SMT, but other differents apply.  First, you cannot save a Blog Entry 
locally; you'll find on the Advanced tab that there is a Post ID rather than a local file name.  Second, you cannot modify 
the URL's to Ping field of this entry - MT doesn't send it to me!  Lastly, you cannot "clear" the categories - you may change 
whatever you'd like with the categories but you if you set it to "(none)" it will be ignored by the XML-RPC routines.  Because 
of these restrictions, you'll also notice a "Edit in Browser" option when you right mouse click.  One more thing: when dealing 
with multiple Blogs, I <b>strongly recommend</b> making sure that you've refreshed your categories before opening any drafts or 
server-based entries because MT bases the categories off index values and not names!
<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I had a number of drafts saved and half of my settings have been forgotten - what's wrong?<br><br>
A: Odds are you changed from 1.x to 2.x.  The drafts structure has changed a great deal, so none of the existing 
drafts can be loaded the same way.  They are still stored on your hard drive in the original SharpMT directory (blogDrafts.xml).  
You'll also notice that the list of Blog Links is gone - that changed it's location to a more accessible location 
on your hard drive.  The Drafts and Advanced tabs are gone too, replaced with a new dialog and a new tab.  You should 
be able to refresh your blog list, categories, blog links, and text formatting options and be back up and running!<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I'm trying to use SharpMT, but it keeps failing while trying to access my blog server.  I'm <b>certain</b> 
that my host name, CGI-BIN path, user name and password are all correct - what's wrong?<br><br>
A: If your blog server is hosted by an IIS (version 5.x) Server that's running MobileType 2.x, there is a know 
problem with one of the MT modules, but it is easily resolved. In the MT\ExtLib\XMLRPC\Transport directory, 
open the HTTP.pm file. Add the following line: <pre>undef $ENV{SERVER_SOFTWARE};</pre>before this line:
<pre>@XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::CGI::ISA = qw(SOAP::Transport::HTTP::CGI);</pre> and SharpMT should start 
be able to access the server.  Windows Server 2003 does not exhibit this behavior.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I'm not running IIS and I still can't connect.  What's wrong this time?<br><br>
A: There was a bug with Beta 1 and 2 of SharpMT 1.0 that prevented SharpMT from accessing web servers 
that host more than one Blog.  This was fixed in Beta 3.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I've noticed that there's a number of "Multi" options now for SharpMT 2 - what's the bottom line?<br><br>
A: A number of things can handle multiple objects while a couple cannot.  You can open multiple Drafts at the same time; you 
cannot open multiple Blog Entries at the same time.  You can save all open Drafts at the same time; because you cannot save any 
Blog Entries locally, these are ignored when you select "Save All".  "Close All" will close all open Drafts and Blog Entries.  
"Delete" will delete all selected Blog Links.  Lastly, "Post All Open Drafts" will post new entries of all open local Drafts and 
post updates to any open Blog Entries; "Post to Server" will add a new entry or update an existing entry for the current selected 
Draft/Entry.
<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I had the default text formatting set to "Convert Line Breaks" but after I upgraded to 1.2, it's now set to 
None - what happened?<br><br>
A: Support for Text Filters is what happened.  Out of the box, SharpMT comes with "no" Text Filters, so you need 
to sync them up with the server.  Click the "Update Text Filters" button and you'll get the list of text filters 
on your server, which will almost always include "Convert Line Breaks".  Once you've updated this list, you can re-set 
the defaults via the Options dialog.  Sorry for the confusion, but this had to be done to add this new feature.
<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I keep setting the publishing status of my drafts to "Draft" yet when I upload them to my MT server, 
they show up as Publish - why is this happening?<br><br>
A: This is by design, accoring to the 2.1 (and later) release of MT: <i>In 2.1 we changed the behavior of 
the $publish flag. Previously, it was used to determine the post status. That was a bad idea.
So now entries added through XML-RPC are always set to publish,
*unless* the user has set "NoPublishMeansDraft 1" in mt.cfg, which
enables the old behavior.</i><br><br></li>

<li>Q: Why is it that whenever I try to use "Edit with Browser" I get an error or the login screen for 
my Blog?<br><br>
A: For the Edit in Browser feature to work, you must a) be online to access your Blog server and b) you 
<b><i>must</i> use the Remember Me option</b> when you log in to your Blog.  If you don't use Remember Me, 
then the Blog 
server will always expect you to log in!<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I keep seeing the error message: The Spell Checker cannot be found! when I try to run SharpMT.  
How can I fix this?<br><br>
A: Some how one of the files SharpMT requires to run is missing - please reinstall SharpMT and the 
file will be reinstalled.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: How do I change the images that are used in the toolbar?<br><br>
A: Originally SharpMT had skinable toolbars, but since there was never any adoption of this, and it was becoming a pain to maintain, it was cut from SharpMT 3 (and later).<br><br></li>

<li>Q: Why don't you support multiple categories and the keywords or URLs to Ping fields?<br><br>
A: I do, as of 1.0 Beta 3.  Go get the latest version!<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I turned on the Tracing Window and now I can't close it.  What does it do, by the way?<br><br>
A: Tracing was added in Beta 4 to help troubleshoot the problems that people are having with SharpMT and 
their particular Blog configuration.  It can be turned on and off via the Options dialog and should only be 
turned on if you're having problems. The tracing window was purposely built not to close; if tracing is on it 
stays on for the whole session.  This is also why this dialog box opens minimized and is show in the task bar: 
it should be easy to get to but it should also be easily forgotten, unless it's needed.  <br><br></li>

<li>Q: I don't like the way SharpMT is display my previews - can I change the formatting?<br><br>
A: Yes!  When SharpMT was installed it included a file named previewHtml.htm - this includes a default template 
for displaying your drafts in SharpMT.  You can edit this file however you see fit - the following optional values 
are used to reflect the current draft's fields: &lt;MTEntryTitle&gt; &lt;MTEntryCategory&gt; &lt;MTEntryBody&gt; 
&lt;MTEntryMore&gt; &lt;MTEntryExcerpt&gt;<br><br></li>

<li>Q: When I use the Preview mode, I'm seeing "something wrong with line breaks" - what causes this?<br><br>
A: The Preview mode uses the draft's "Text Formatting" settings, converting line breaks as it would when you posted
a draft to your server.  If you're seeing strange line breaks, change the text formatting setting for this draft.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: Why is every image upload based off the Blog URL and why can I only upload images?<br><br>
A: These two items are related.  The upload of the images is part of the MT functionality exposed via the XML-RPC 
- it is not an FTP upload!  Since MT expects the uploaded file to be an image, it treats it like an image.  Can 
other types of files be uploaded?  I'm sure it could, but I don't know what it would look like when it got to the 
server.  As to what the directory location is, that is also part of the specification.  If you select a local image 
called image1.jpg and upload it to the server with the "remote name" of _images/screenshot1.jpg it will be found 
at [blogURL]/_images/screenshot1.jpg - that root location is set by MT; the file name is whatever you tell SharpMT 
you want it to be.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I'd rather use strong and em for bold and italics; can I change the default tags?<br><br>
A: Yes - this was added in version 1.2.  To customize the tags that SharpMT generates for bold, italics and underline 
formatting commands, go to Customize Tags under the Format menu.  You only need to change the letters for each tag; the 
rest of the formatting is still managed by SharpMT.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I have music playing with Windows Media Player, so why does SharpMT tell me that it can't find any music?<br><br>
A: You need the Blogging plug-in!  Go to: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/windowsmediaplayer/downloads/create.asp" 
target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/windowsmediaplayer/downloads/create.asp</a> and download the blogging plug-in.  I 
also believe that the WinAMP 2 and WinAMP 3 plugins from <a href="http://www.minimalverbosity.com/2003/April/29/introducing_wmpamplog.htm"
 target="_blank">http://www.minimalverbosity.com/2003/April/29/introducing_wmpamplog.htm</a> will work as well.
<br><br></li>

<li>Q: Does only the Extended Entry window grow automatically?  Can't I make the other windows bigger?<br><br>
A: Yes!  Get the latest version of SharpMT as this was added in 2.1.  The Title/Category section and the Excerpt 
section can be Minimized and the Body and Extended entry sections can be resized using the splitter bar.  The 
most resently saved window positions will be stored by SharpMT to open drafts or create new drafts with, offering 
as persistant settings as possible: if you minimize the top and bottom sections and close SharpMT any other draft that 
you open (or create) will start with them Minimize until they are changed.  Body and Extended can't have a Minimize 
option, as they share the same space, but either of the two can be "minimized" by moving the splitter window up or down.
<br><br></li>

<li>Q: What's the deal with the Insert Image link checkbox on the upload image dialog?<br><br>
A: This was added in SharpMT 2.1 - basically, if you had your cursor in an edit box and clicked Upload Image, you 
now have to option of injecting a link, with a couple of image properties, set to point to the image you just uploaded. 
The tag format that is used is set on the Tag's tab on the Options dialog.  There are two values that can be filled in 
by SharpMT: [IMAGELINK], which is the image's blog based link, and [ALTTAG], which will be filled in with the ALT field 
on the Upload dialog.  For example, if your Image tag was set to &lt;img src="[IMAGELINK]" alt="[ALTTAG]" border="0"&gt; and you 
uploaded an image (with the "insert tag" check box selected) then that tag would be inserted into your draft with 
the [] values filled in.  If you open the Upload Image dialog and the check box is disabled, you didn't have focus 
on a control that could accept the created link - put focus on an edit box and re-open the dialog.
