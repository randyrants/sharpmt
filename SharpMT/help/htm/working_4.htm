<div id="headline">Spell Checking</div>
By default, spell checking is enabled to run in an interactive mode, with the four major text box fields: Title, Entry Body, Extended Entry, and Excerpt.  While you are typing, spell check records what is being typed; when you stop typing for about a second, you will see a red underline appear under anything that is misspelled.  When a bit of text has a red line underneath it, right mouse click over it and a list of suggested corrections will appear along with other options:
<br><br>
<ul>Spell Check menu items:
<li>(word suggestions, if any)</li>
<li>Add - adds this word to the user's dictionary for this and future spell checks</li>
<li>Ignore All - ignores the current word for this text box only</li>
<li>Undo - Reverses the last change to this text box</li>
<li>Select All - Selects all of the text in this text box</li>
</ul>
<br>
<div id="subheadline">Manual Spell Check</div>
In the event that you've turned off the interactive spell checking, via the Spell Check Options dialog, this process will check the text in each of the four text boxes on the current draft.  Please note that there is no way to interrupt this process once started: it will check each of the four boxes, even if you click cancel at the first opportunity.
<br><br>
<div id="subheadline">Spell Check Options</div>
Within this dialog you can us the Options made available by the Spell Check module, including the ability to turn off the interactive spell checking, viewing/modifying the user dictionary, and the list of common misspelling.
<br><br>
<div id="subheadline">Other Dictionaries</div>
As part of the Spell Check module, you can change the setting to use non-US English dictionaries: at <a href="http://www.randyrants.com/rr/software.asp" target="_blank">RandyRants.com</a>, you can download a UK English and Canadian English dictionary pack, as well additional instructions on how to install these dictionaries.
