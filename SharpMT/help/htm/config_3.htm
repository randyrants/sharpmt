<div id="headline">Draft Defaults</div>
Options in this panel will impact the Advanced settings of newly created drafts.  They are useful to set up preferences for options that are often the same on all new drafts.

<div id="subheadline">Draft Default Options</div>
<dl>
<dt>Post Status:</dt>
<dd>This value can be either Publish or Draft.  However, please be aware that as of the time of this writing that MT will post <i>any</i> draft posted to MT from a non-MT page as "Published".  For more information on a workaround for this, please check the online FAQ for the most up to date information.</dd>
<dt>Comments:</dt>
<dd>Comments have three states to select from for all drafts: None, Open, and Closed.  Which is select here will be the default on all new drafts.</dd>
<dt>Text Formatting:</dt>
<dd>This is a Blog-server generated list and will be different for each user.  It is refreshed as a rule whenever a Blog-server setting is changed via the Server Options, so as to keep up to date.  The items in this list will include any MT-server based plug-ins that you've installed on your server; as a default, all MT servers have "Convert Line Breaks" as a default Text Filter.  The options available, after an initial Blog has been configured, will often be None and Convert Line Breaks.</dd>
<dt>Allow Pings:</dt>
<dd>Allowing pings will mean that Trackbacks can be applied for a given Blog post; this option can always be overridden on a draft-by-draft basis.</dd>
<dt>Use Server Time:</dt>
<dd>One of the advanced fields that can be set for a draft is "Authored on" time and date.  If this option is checked, when a new draft is created, it will use the server time, when the draft is sent to the server, to determine the "authored on" time and date stamp.  If this option is unchecked, then the unpublished draft will capture the date and time at the time of the creation of the draft and when it is sent to the server, this time stamp will be used as a publish time.  Regardless of this setting, you may always change this option on a draft-by-draft basis.</dd>
<dt>Upload Image Path:</dt>
<dd>You have the option of putting a partial path in this text box; it will be used as the default for the Upload Image dialog box's path value.  For example, if you keep all of your images at http://www.hostname.com/Images/ then you can put Images/ in this text box so that you don't have to type it every time you upload an image.</dd>
<dt>Target:</dt>
<dd>When inserting a link into a draft, there is a target attribute that can be one of four standard HTML values, a custom name of a frame, or completely left out.  If you want this field to default to a particular value, when the link dialog is shown, you can enter it here.</dd>
