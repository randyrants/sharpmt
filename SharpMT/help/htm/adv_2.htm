<div id="headline">Blog Links</div>
Blog Links were designed to fulfill two very specific needs - one while offline and one while online - and are maintained whenever possible.  The Blog Links list is a list of Blog entries that have already been posted to the server.  The list is kept in sync by telling SharpMT to ask the Blog server for an up to date list of links; when you post a new entry from within SharpMT it automatically updates the Blog Links to include the new post.  Also, the options set on the <a href="config_1.htm">Server Options</a> dialog are use to either append new links to the existing list or to clear the existing and build a new one with the new links.
<br><br>
<div id="subheadline">Editing Existing Posts (while online)</div>
From the Blog Links window - available under the Windows menu - you will see a list of Blog Links with both their titles and server based ID numbers.  If you are online and double click a link, SharpMT will retrieve the post from the server and display this existing post as a new tab; online-based posts will be shown with a URL link icon, rather than a document one.  If you make changes to this post, and want these changes sent to the server, select the <a href="working_2.htm">Post command</a> for this entry.
<br>
<ul>Caveats:
<li>Trackbacks cannot be added or edited though this interface - those can only be changed via the Blog's native pages/tools.
<li>Updates to posted entries can only be done this way; only drafts that have the link image on it tab will be updated - all other drafts that are re-posted to the server will make a new entry.  For example, create a new draft in SharpMT, type some text and then post it to the server.  If you stay on this first tab - the one with the document and green arrow - make some changes and Post it again, you will create a <b>second</b> post on the server.  If you want to edit a newly posted draft, double click it via the Blog Links window; any changes made to that version will be <b>updated</b> on the server.
</ul>
<br>
<div id="subheadline">Add URL: Blog Links (anytime)</div>
The same list that is maintained in the Blog Links window is available for inner-blog linking between different posts.  This is very useful when you want to reference an existing post in a newer draft and can't get to the web to find the exact permalink; the Blog Links have already stored the permalink, which allows you to find the post without the network.
<br><br>
<div id="headline">Blog Links Window</div>
The Blog Links window itself has a number of interesting features for the most flexible UI design possible.  While turned off by default, it can be turned on via the Windows menu.  When activated, it can be docked to a side of the main window or float on its own.  If docked to an edge it can always be shown or auto-hide itself to act like a "tab".  All of these features are configurable on a per user basis.
