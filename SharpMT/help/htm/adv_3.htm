SharpMT uses the support offered by most Blog engines to upload images to your Blog server.
<br><br>
<div id="subheadline">Upload Image options</div>
<dl>
<dt>Select an image to upload:</dt>
<dd>Click the Browse button to select an image to upload.  At this time, images are only supported format that is allowed by most Blog servers and only one image may be uploaded at a time.</dd>
<dt>Enter the path and name of the remote image:</dt>
<dd>In some cases you will want to direct the uploaded image to a location other than the root of the Blog and you might even want it to be hosted with a file name that's different than the local file.  This is quite common for sites that have a "photo of the day" on display: the image uploaded will probably have a unique name locally but you want to overwrite the existing potd.jpg file.</dd>
<dt>The remote path will be relative to the Blog URL:</dt>
<dd>This is the current Blog URL, shown as a different for you, so that you know where the file is going.</dd>
<dt>Insert IMG tag with this link as SRC:</dt>
<dd>Assuming that you have a draft already open before opening the Upload Image dialog, you will be giving the option of inserting an image tag into the draft with the SRC attribute set to the link of the newly uploaded image.  The format of this is defined on the <a href="config_4.htm">Tags Options</a> dialog.</dd>
<dt>ALT attribute:</dt>
<dd>If the Image Tag that is defined with the [ALTTAG] placeholder, the text entered in this field is used in the resulting text.</dd>
