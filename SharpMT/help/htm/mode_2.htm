<div id="headline">Advanced tab</div>
The Advanced tab contains a number of "not-so-oftenly" used fields that are saved with each draft.  These fields too mirror what is available on the Blog server, yet aren't often changed which is why they are on a secondary tab.
<br><br>

<dl><u>Advanced fields</u>
<dt>Post Status:</dt>
<dd>Can be set to Publish or Draft; defaults to the setting that is set on the <a href="config_3.htm">Draft Defaults Options</a>. Please be aware that as of the time of this writing that MT will post <i>any</i> draft posted to MT from a non-MT page as "Published". For more information on a workaround for this, please check the online FAQ for the most up to date information.</dd>
<dt>Comments:</dt>
<dd>Can be set to None, Open, or Closed; defaults to the setting that is set on the <a href="config_3.htm">Draft Defaults Options</a>.</dd>
<dt>Text Formatting:</dt>
<dd>This is a Blog-server generated list and will be different for each user. As a rule, it is refreshed whenever a Blog-server setting is changed via the <a href="config_1.htm">Server Options</a>, so as to keep up to date. The items in this list will include any MT-server based plug-ins that you've installed on your server; as a default, all MT servers have "Convert Line Breaks" as a default Text Filter. The options available, after an initial Blog has been configured, will often be None and Convert Line Breaks; defaults to the setting that is set on the <a href="config_3.htm">Draft Defaults Options</a>.</dd>
<dt>Keywords:</dt>
<dd>Corresponds to the little-seen Keywords field within the Blog server.</dd>
<dt>Allow Pings:</dt>
<dd>Allowing pings will mean that Trackbacks can be sent for a given Blog post; defaults to the setting that is set on the <a href="config_3.htm">Draft Defaults Options</a>.</dd>
<dt>URLs to Ping:</dt>
<dd>Enter any Trackback URLs that you want to be pinged when this draft is built; put one URL per line, using the Enter key to separate more than one URL.</dd>
<dt>Authored on:</dt>
<dd>When set to "Use Server Time" no particular Date/Time value sent when posting to the Blog server which allows/forces the Blog server to define the post's Authored On value.  If you click this button, you can change this draft's Date/Timestamp to be any valid date/time value.  If the Draft Defaults Options dialog is set to "Use Server Time" then this button defaults to that; if not it is initially set to when the draft was created (and can then be changed).</dd>
<dt>Local filename:</dt>
<dd>If this draft has been saved at least once, the absolute path and file name will be listed here.</dd>
<dt>Posted/Not Posted</dt>
<dd>This label corresponds to the tab icon, showing whether or not SharpMT has posted this draft to the server.  If you click on this label, you can toggle between posted/not posted states; this setting is saved with each draft and is used stictly for bookkeeping within SharpMT.</dd>
