One of the things that makes SharpMT a unique application is that it targets one particular Blog server type, where as other Blog writers often try to support as many as possible.  Because of this decision, the format and functionality of SharpMT  often parallels the format and functionality of MT; it has been designed to be an offline extension of MT, rather than a "one-size-fits-all" Blog writer.
