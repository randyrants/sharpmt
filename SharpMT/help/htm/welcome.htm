<i>"It's deja vu, all over again" [Yogi Berra]</i>
<br><br>

This is the third generation of an application that was created out of necessity over anything else. I write a Blog of my own (<a href="http://www.randyrants.com" target="_blank">RandyRants.com</a>) and I try to get two or three new entries posted to it a week. I currently use <a href="http://www.typepad.org/" target="_blank">TypePad</a> but have historically used MovableType (MT) - http://www.movabletype.org/ - to host my Blog, which provides a number of tools for posting new and editing exiting Blog entries. Thankfully MT and TypePad are completely compatible, so this project can continue to be useful.  Anyway, to use these tools, your PC needs to be online - because I find that I write the majority of my new Blog entries offline, I needed something new. 
<br><br>
I tried a few different tools out there that promised exactly that: offline authoring. However, most of these applications were written with the most generic set of blog fields possible, to support the largest number of blogging servers possible. I use TypePad/MT and I needed all of the fields that were specifically offered, so these existing tools didn't work for me. Also, I found that when I wanted to link new entries to existing entries, I had to go online and dig through my old posts to find the article link, which was painful at times. 
<br><br>
And so I started SharpMT which now continues its evolution.
