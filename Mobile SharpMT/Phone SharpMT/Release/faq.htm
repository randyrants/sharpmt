<div id="headline">Welcome to Pocket SharpMT</div>
This is an application that was created out of user requests over anything else.  I write a Blog of my own 
(<a href="http://www.randyrants.com/">RandyRants.com</a>) and I try to get two or three new entries posted to it 
a week.  I use MovableType (MT) - <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/" target="_blank">http://www.movabletype.org/</a> - 
to host my Blog, which provides a number of tools for posting new and editing exiting Blog entries.  However, 
to use these tools, your PC needs to be online - because I find that I write the majority of my new Blog entries 
offline, I needed something new so I created SharpMT.  
<br><br>
SharpMT is an offline Blog writer that was designed for use on a PC and has grown up a great deal over the course 
of 2003.  From growing userbase of SharpMT, I had gotten a couple of requests for a Pocket PC version of SharpMT.
I originally dismissed these out of turn because of a few reasons.  One was that it would require a bit of 
porting from the original SharpMT to make a Pocket PC version - I never believed in just copy and pasting the code 
because what might work well on a PC might not work well on a smaller screened device.  I also thought that it 
would be insane to try to type up a Blog entry on a Pocket PC, so I didn't give it much thought until recently.  
Give the recent rise of mobile devices with built-in cameras, wireless Internet access, and the interest in 
Mobile Blogging, this project suddenly made a lot more sense.  I thought it would be cool to travel with a Pocket PC, 
snap some random pictures, jot down a note, and then send the post up to a MT server - it could be useful for 
the growing number of MoBlogging authors, as well as people that have fold-out keyboards for their Pocket PC's.
<br><br>
In the summer of 2006 Smartphone started to appear with thumbpads: phones that look like a Pocket PC but are running with 
the Smartphone software.  To support these devices, it required a full blown port and redesign.  Originally there were no 
plans to do this... after all, who would want to tap out a blog entry using a standard 12 button keypad?!  But as hardware 
evolves, so much we all.  That lead to this latest incarnation of SharpMT: Phone SharpMT.  It was created for the Smartphone 
platform; Pocket SharpMT is still for the Pocket PC.
<br><br>
Now we've got a Pocket SharpMT and a Phone SharpMT: both will co-exist as they grow!
<br><br>

<div id="subheadline">Troubleshooting</div>

<ol>
<li>Q: I have a Treo 700w, T-Mobile MDA, HTC Wizard, or a smartphone with a <b>touch</b> screen.  Which version do I use?<br><br>

A: Safe bet is that it's a Pocket PC based phone.  The keyword is touch screen: no Smartphone offers a touch screen at this time.  If you try to install Pocket SharpMT and it fails, give Phone SharpMT a try.<br><br></li?

<li>Q: I have a Motorola Q, T-Mobile SDA, HTC Star Trek, or a smartphone with<b>out</b> a touch screen.  Which version do I use?<br><br>

A: Safe bet is that it's a Smartphone device.  The keyword is touch screen: all Smartphone don't have a touch screen right now.  The Q is the most confusing in this area: it has a thumb keyboard like a Pocket PC would but it doesn't have a touch screen... it's a Smartphone.  If you try to install Phone SharpMT and it fails, give Pocket SharpMT a try.<br><br></li>


<li>Q: I have a Nokia or LG phone!  Which version do I use?<br><br>

A: You have J2ME or BREW.  I will <b>not</b> be bring SharpMT to these devices.  Sorry!<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I clicked on the Pocket SharpMT icon and I'm told that I need a newer version of the .NET Compact Framework, but I 
have 1.0 installed.  What newer version?<br>
Q: I tried to run your application, but I'm getting a huge message box, with an error that tells me it can't
find some DLL files.  What's wrong?<br>
Q: I installed SharpMT on my computer and when I start the program up it says it can't find MSCOREE.DLL.<br><br>

A: Your Pocket PC has to have the 2.0 version of the .NET Compact Framework installed on it!  You can get this from the 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9655156b-356b-4a2c-857c-e62f50ae9a55&displaylang=en">Windows Mobile website</a>.
Windows Mobile 5.0 devices sometimes come with the Framework pre-installed, but not always.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I'm trying to use Pocket SharpMT, but it keeps failing while trying to access my blog server.  I'm <b>certain</b> 
that my host name, CGI-BIN path, user name and password are all correct - what's wrong?<br><br>

A: If your blog server is hosted by an IIS (version 5.x) Server that's running MobileType 2.x, there is a know 
problem with one of the MT modules, but it is easily resolved. In the MT\ExtLib\XMLRPC\Transport directory, 
open the HTTP.pm file. Add the following line: <pre>undef $ENV{SERVER_SOFTWARE};</pre>before this line:
<pre>@XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::CGI::ISA = qw(SOAP::Transport::HTTP::CGI);</pre> and SharpMT should start 
be able to access the server.  Windows Server 2003 does not exhibit this behavior.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I keep setting the publishing status of my drafts to "Draft" yet when I upload them to my MT server, 
they show up as Publish - why is this happening?<br><br>

A: This is by design, accoring to the 2.1 (and later) release of MT: <i>In 2.1 we changed the behavior of 
the $publish flag. Previously, it was used to determine the post status. That was a bad idea.
So now entries added through XML-RPC are always set to publish,
*unless* the user has set "NoPublishMeansDraft 1" in mt.cfg, which
enables the old behavior.</i><br><br></li>

<li>Q: I love using the Tracing Window, Preview mode, and Blog Links features in SharpMT - why don't I see 
them in Pocket SharpMT?<br><br>

A: Long answer short: real estate, memory, speed, and functionality.  Pocket SharpMT has been designed mostly 
with mobile blogging in mind.  SharpMT was designed to be an offline authoring tool, taking advantage of a 
PC type device.  Not all of the SharpMT features would fit nor did they make sense on the Pocket PC.  If there's 
something from SharpMT that you'd like to see in Pocket SharpMT, drop me a line and I'll consider adding it - if 
I can!
<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I heard that the Drafts from SharpMT can be brought to Pocket SharpMT and vice versa.  How do I do this?<br><br>

A: As of version 2 of SharpMT and Pocket SharpMT each draft is stored in its file; SharpMT drafts end in a SMT extension.  
Simply moving these files back and forth between your POcket PC and Desktop PC will move your drafts from device to desktop; it 
is as simple as that!
<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I was a Pocket SharpMT 1.x user and I've since upgraded to 2.x - where are my drafts and do I need the old Pocket 
SharpMT directory?<br><br>

A: All of your old drafts are actually still stored on the device in the blogDrafts.xml file that is located in \My Documents\Pocket 
SharpMT.  If you need to convert older drafts to the new SharpMT format, bring the blogDrafts.xml file to a PC, run the converter
utility that comes with SharpMT 2.x for the desktop, and copy the resulting SMT files back to the device.  Otherwise, SharpMT 2 
does not need this old directory.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I have a [Windows Mobile 2003 device, Pocket PC Phone Edition device, Pocket PC 2002 device] - can I use 
Pocket SharpMT?<br><br>

A: Any device that can run the 2.0 release of the .NET Compact Framework should be able to run Pocket SharpMT.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: Why is every image upload based off the Blog URL and why can I only upload images?<br><br>

A: These two items are related.  The upload of the images is part of the MT functionality exposed via the XML-RPC 
- it is not an FTP upload!  Since MT expects the uploaded file to be an image, it treats it like an image.  Can 
other types of files be uploaded?  I'm sure it could, but I don't know what it would look like when it got to the 
server.  As to what the directory location is, that is also part of the specification.  If you select a local image 
called image1.jpg and upload it to the server with the "remote name" of _images/screenshot1.jpg it will be found 
at [blogURL]/_images/screenshot1.jpg - that root location is set by MT; the file name is whatever you tell SharpMT 
you want it to be.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I'd rather use strong and em for bold and italics; can I change the default tags?<br><br>

A: Yes.  To customize the tags that Pocket SharpMT generates for bold, italics and underline 
formatting commands, go to Customize Tags under the Format menu.  You only need to change the letters for each tag; the 
rest of the formatting is still managed by Pocket SharpMT.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: I'm getting a stange error message and am then told to re-install when I try to use "Insert Contact".  
What's wrong?<br><br>

A: Pocket SharpMT is looking for a file named pocketoutlook.dll which should have been installed with the rest 
of the application.  Re-installing will put another copy of this file in the \Program Files\Pocket SharpMT 
directory.  The application will run without this file but you will not be able to use the Insert Contact option 
without this file.<br><br></li>

<li>Q; Do I need a WiFi card to use Pocket SharpMT?<br><br>

A: No.  You can also post to your blog via the "pass through" network connection that ActiveSync offers or via Bluetooth.  
Pocket SharpMT will use whatever Internet it can find when posting online.<br><br></li>

<li>Q: What's the deal with the Insert Image link checkbox on the upload image dialog?<br><br>

A: This was added in SharpMT 2.1 - basically, if you had your cursor in an edit box and clicked Upload Image, you 
now have to option of injecting a link, with a couple of image properties, set to point to the image you just uploaded. 
The tag format that is used is set on the Tag's tab on the Options dialog.  There are two values that can be filled in 
by SharpMT: [IMAGELINK], which is the image's blog based link, and [ALTTAG], which will be filled in with the ALT field 
on the Upload dialog.  For example, if your Image tag was set to &lt;img src="[IMAGELINK]" alt="[ALTTAG]" border="0"&gt; and you 
uploaded an image (with the "insert tag" check box selected) then that tag would be inserted into your draft with 
the [] values filled in.  If you open the Upload Image dialog and the check box is disabled, you didn't have focus 
on a control that could accept the created link - put focus on an edit box and re-open the dialog.
